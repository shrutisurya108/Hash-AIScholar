00:00 When you ask artificial
intelligence, like chat GPT a
00:04 question, like, what is the
best way to slice bread It
00:08 provides an answer that
seems like a human expert.
00:12 The AI appears to know about
types of knives and that bread
00:16 is heated when cooked.
00:18 Does AI really know these things? How
can it know about so many topics?
00:23 Can we trust the answers?
00:26 To answer those questions,
00:27 let's look at the source of
the information used by tools like ChatGPT.
00:32 Large language models.
00:35 Imagine the task of scanning
every word on the internet.
00:39 That's every blog, website,
research paper, book,
00:43 newspaper, computer
program, and more.
00:47 That's the goal of massive
computers that power tools like
00:51 chat GPT to capture
everything it can on the web.
00:56 This snapshot of over a
trillion words creates the
01:00 foundation for large
language models.
01:04 By analyzing the words in the
model, chat GPT can answer our
01:08 questions and requests
with human like quality.
01:11 What sounds like expertise
01:13 is really a math problem
for artificial intelligence.
01:17 It works because powerful
computers are trained to look
01:21 for common patterns
between words and phrases,
01:24 like tomorrow morning,
01:26 cup of coffee, and
suppose that you.
01:30 Large language models
can also detect context.
01:35 It can tell based on words
that appear together, if you mean
01:39 bat or bat,
01:41 every word becomes
a math problem.
01:43 That uses artificial
intelligence to find what word
01:47 should come next in a sentence.
01:50 So when we ask AI, how to
slice bread It doesn't know
01:54 about bread or knives like
you and me. It only knows the
01:58 words in the large
language model.
02:00 Because it was trained on
a trillion words and their
02:03 context, it can assemble the words
that most often answer that question.
02:09 Keep in mind,
02:10 that AI responses are based
on what's published on the
02:14 internet and like the internet, they
can be biased, misleading, and inaccurate.
02:21 Evaluation and use them
with skepticism and care.
02:25 With experimentation
and practice,
02:27 you can use these tools
to easily access the world's
02:30 knowledge and find the
answers you need quickly.
